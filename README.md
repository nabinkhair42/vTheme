## Color Theory Behind the Design

V Theme is meticulously designed using advanced color theory principles to create a visually pleasing, harmonious, and productive coding environment.

### Triadic Color Scheme

The theme is built around a **triadic color palette** - three colors equidistant on the color wheel that provide both harmony and vibrant contrast:

- **Deep Blue-Purple (#2E2A4D)** - Primary background color that's easy on the eyes during long coding sessions
- **Vibrant Orange-Gold (#F7B32B)** - Accent color for highlighting active elements
- **Teal (#34B0A5)** - Accent color for functions and special elements

This balanced approach creates visual interest while maintaining color harmony.

### Strategic Color Psychology

Colors were carefully selected based on their psychological impact:

- **Blue-Purple tones** - Promotes concentration, creativity, and focus
- **Gold accents** - Provides energy and optimism to break the monotony
- **Teal highlights** - Creates a sense of clarity and balance

### Accessibility & Readability

The theme maintains excellent contrast ratios between text and backgrounds, following accessibility best practices to ensure readability during long coding sessions. Comments are subtly distinguished without sacrificing legibility.
