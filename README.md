## Color Theory Behind the Design

V Theme is meticulously designed using advanced color theory principles to create a visually pleasing, harmonious, and productive coding environment.

### Dark Theme: Modern Blue-Gray Harmony

The dark theme features a clean, modern color palette:

- **Deep Blue-Gray (#212836)** - Primary background color that's easy on the eyes
- **Teal Accent (#64FFDA)** - Primary accent for highlighting important elements
- **Complementary Accents** - Carefully selected colors for syntax highlighting

### Light Theme: Clean and Refreshing

The light theme maintains a professional appearance with:

- **Soft Blue-White (#F5F8FA)** - Gentle background that reduces eye strain
- **Teal Accent (#00A3A3)** - Primary accent that provides continuity with the dark theme
- **Balanced Contrast** - Careful color selection for readability in bright environments

### Strategic Color Psychology

Colors were carefully selected based on their psychological impact:

- **Blue tones** - Promote concentration, creativity, and focus
- **Teal accents** - Create a sense of clarity and balance
- **Proper contrast** - Ensures readability without causing eye fatigue

### Accessibility & Readability

Both themes maintain excellent contrast ratios between text and backgrounds, following accessibility best practices to ensure readability during long coding sessions. Comments are subtly distinguished without sacrificing legibility.
