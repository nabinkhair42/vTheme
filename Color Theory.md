# Color Theory Elements in V Theme Dark

## 1. Analogous Color Scheme
- **Theory:** Analogous colors are those next to each other on the color wheel (e.g., blue → teal → cyan)
- **Effect:** Creates a harmonious, unified look that's easy on the eyes
- **Example:** Navy (#0A192F), teal (#64FFDA), soft cyan — all cool tones that flow naturally

## 2. Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV Model)
- **Theory:** Good themes vary hue (color), saturation (intensity), and value (lightness/darkness) to create visual hierarchy
- **Effect:** Guides attention subtly without visual noise
- **Example:** Bright functions vs. muted comments — this difference in value and saturation helps users prioritize information

## 3. Cool Colors Psychology
- **Theory:** Blues, greens, and teals are "cool" colors that evoke calmness, stability, and focus
- **Effect:** Users feel relaxed and attentive, not overstimulated
- **Impact:** Ideal for development environments, where long focus sessions are key

## 4. Contrast and Accessibility
- **Theory:** Contrast between background and foreground improves legibility
- **Effect:** Lowers cognitive load, improves code comprehension
- **Implementation:** Uses dark backgrounds with soft-light text and just enough contrast for syntax clarity

## 5. Visual Hierarchy Using Color
- **Theory:** High-saturation or bright colors draw the eye; desaturated or darker colors recede
- **Effect:** Important code elements stand out; less important ones fade back
- **Application:** Functions and variables are brighter than comments or brackets

## 6. Minimal Palette Reduces Cognitive Load
- **Theory:** Too many colors overwhelm working memory
- **Effect:** The brain can process code faster with less color variation
- **Implementation:** Uses a limited but expressive palette

### V Theme is backed by these features:
- Analogous harmony
- Color hierarchy via HSV
- Emotionally calming tones
- Just-right contrast
- Reduced cognitive noise
